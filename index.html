           Being able to work as a developer has been my <span class='highlight'>dream</span> since I was 11, I just didn’t know it back then.
           At the time I was just looking to impress my friends. 9 years ago just doing anything with a computer was sure to get great reactions.
           Trust me when I say making phone calls from a handheld gaming system really gets the crowd going.

      <p>
        Since then my desire has led me to sharing my coding <span class='highlight'>passion</span> as a teacher while working for a startup. I’ve learned I’m
        <span class='highlight'>quick on my feet</span>. At this position we taught Javascript using a custom framework to help educate the students.
        I began my first day looking to my peers for help and by the end of the second week the others looked to me for help.
        This is an important trait to have especially in a volatile market, like web development, where <span class='highlight'>new standards</span> are popping up like daisies.

        Working at a startup has really pushed me to <span class='highlight'>look outside the box</span>.
        Ideas can always be improved and I feel at my current role I’ve always looked for ways to do that.
        Based on my <span class='highlight'>experience</span> working in the classrooms it’s easy to identify weakness’ in the UI of the company's platform.
        I’ve <span class='highlight'>actively communicated</span> this dissatisfaction to the team and we’ve been able to implement a
        solution that benefits both the employees and the students.

      <p>
        At the end of the day I’m <span class='highlight'>driven</span> to always <span class='highlight'>improve</span> and find ways to push the envelope forward.
        I always make sure to dedicate a large part of my day to advancing my skills as a web developer.
        It is this passion that has driven every one of my career decisions thus far.

        I look forward to contributing my <span class='highlight'>skills</span> and experience to the company and hope we have an opportunity to speak
        further about how I can be an <span class='highlight'>skills</span>asset</span> to the team.
